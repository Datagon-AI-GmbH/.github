# .github
 The .github repository centralizes shared GitHub templates and configurations for our organization. 
 
 It includes issue and pull request templates, along with other settings, ensuring consistency and streamlining workflows across all repositories. This requires it to be set to Public (see: https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
